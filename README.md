# Wirdi
Daily islamic habits. Reminders. Counters. Dhikr etc based on famous litanies

## What this is

Wirdi is a Flutter app for daily Islamic practice: wird collections, dhikr
collections and Quran surahs, with counters and reminders.

This repository holds two things: the **content pipeline** — the Python that turns
source data into the SQLite database the app bundles — and the Flutter **data
layer** that reads it. There is no UI yet.

## The content pipeline

`content/` builds `content/build/content.db` from two kinds of input:

- **Hand-authored JSON** — adhkar, collections and hadith references, written and
  maintained by hand under `content/sources/`, validated against JSON Schema.
- **Quran data** — Uthmani text, the Saheeh International translation, transliteration and
  the juz/hizb/sajdah metadata, downloaded from
  [QUL](https://qul.tarteel.ai/) and normalised by an import script.

The Quran source data is **not committed**. Quran text and translations are
licensed works and are not redistributed through this repository, so each person
who builds the database downloads them from QUL themselves. See
[`content/sources/quran/README.md`](content/sources/quran/README.md).

Every id in the database is either computed by a fixed rule or written by hand in
the source files. Nothing autoincrements. The database is rebuilt from source
regularly, and users' saved collections point at these ids, so an id that shifted
between builds would silently repoint saved content at something else.

## Running it

```bash
pip install -r content/requirements.txt

python3 content/scripts/import_quran.py     # downloaded QUL files -> normalised JSON
python3 content/scripts/validate_json.py    # JSON Schema check of the authored files
python3 content/scripts/build_content.py    # -> content/build/content.db
python3 content/scripts/verify_content.py   # invariant checks, non-zero exit on failure
```

`build_content.py` runs the validator itself and aborts if it fails. The database
is always built from scratch, never incrementally.

You can build and inspect the database before downloading any Quran data — the
Quran tables will be empty and `verify_content.py` will fail until you import.

[`content/README.md`](content/README.md) documents the authoring formats, with a
worked example.

## The data layer

Two SQLite databases, kept separate. They are never joined in SQL; there is no
`ATTACH`.

|  | `content.db` | `user.db` |
|---|---|---|
| Access | read-only | read-write |
| Location | bundled asset, copied to app support on first run | app **documents** directory |
| Contents | Quran, adhkar, sources, built-in collections | user collections, progress, completions, settings |
| Updates | replaced wholesale on app update | migrated, never replaced |

`user.db` is in the documents directory specifically so iOS iCloud backup and
Android Auto Backup pick it up. That is the entire backup strategy: there is no
sync and no server.

```
lib/
  data/
    schema/content.drift    content.db, mirroring the pipeline's SQL
    schema/user.drift       user.db
    content_database.dart   read-only open, schema_version assertion
    user_database.dart
    collection_resolver.dart
    repositories/           the three repository implementations
    database_files.dart     path_provider and the asset copy — the platform seam
  domain/                   hand-written models and the repository interfaces
```

Schemas are `.drift` files rather than Dart table classes: the collection
resolution queries read better as SQL, and keeping the canonical definition in
SQL means `lib/data/schema/content.drift` can be diffed against what the Python
pipeline actually produces. `tool/check_schema_parity.py` is that diff.

Drift's generated row types stop at the repository boundary. `lib/domain/`
imports no drift.

A resolved collection has two views of the same data: `entries` is structural,
with `RepeatBlock`s intact, for display and editing; `steps` is that flattened
for playback, so a three-item block repeated seven times is one entry and
twenty-one steps. Progress indexes `steps` and stores the `ContentRef` it
pointed at, so a reorder or a content update cannot silently resume at the
wrong dhikr — resume through `ResolvedCollection.resumableFrom`, never by
indexing `steps` directly.

SQLite itself comes from `package:sqlite3` 3.x, which downloads a precompiled
library for the target at build time and packages it as a code asset. That
replaces `sqlite3_flutter_libs`, which is end-of-life. `assertSupportedSqlite`
runs at startup and fails if the version in use is old enough to suggest the
platform library is being used instead.

### Running it

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter analyze

# after editing either .drift file or a @DriftDatabase class
dart run build_runner build
```

Generated `*.g.dart` files are committed, so a fresh clone can run the tests
without generating first.

Tests run against in-memory databases seeded with structural placeholder text.
They never read the bundled asset. To build and bundle the real one:

```bash
python3 content/scripts/build_content.py   # -> content/build/content.db
tool/sync_content_asset.sh                 # -> assets/content.db (gitignored)
```
